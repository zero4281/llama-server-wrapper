# Skill Instructions
Delegate the following task to @general:

Read `./Requirements.md` and `./Plan.md`.
Read `./Tests/Testing Strategy.md`.
Perform a gap assessment on the code base, ignoring all files inside `./Tests/`. Look for features to remove that have been implemented but are not required. Then use the gap assessment to create or update `./Update.md` with information about the code updates that are still required. Do not include test coverage or test file changes in `Update.md` — those belong in `TODOs.md` and are handled separately by /project-test-update.
