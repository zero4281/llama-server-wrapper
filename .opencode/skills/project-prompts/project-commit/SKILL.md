# Skill Instructions
Delegate the following task to @general:

If the project is on the main branch then create a new branch with the format: `[feature/bugfix]/[version]-[short-description]` (e.g. `feature/v1.1-user-confirmation-flows`).  If the project is already in a feature branch (not the main branch) then continue without creating a branch.  Check `git status`, use `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` to find new files, then create a git commit message.  Make sure the commit message is only one sentence long.  Then commit the update and push the commit.
